			<h2>Amazeriffic will change your life!</h2>
			<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born 
			   and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
			   the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but 
			   because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor 
			   again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally 
			   circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure... But who has any right to find fault 
			   with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no 
			   resultant pleasure?</p>
